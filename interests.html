            My Interests
        </h1>

        <p>
            My interests are varied and numerous. But the common ground is they are all useful to people in general.
            <br>
            Afterall everything is about the people.

                Futurism
            </h3>
            Reading about, imagining and making some contribution to a better future for people.<br>
            A lot of interesting things will be happening -
            <ul>
                <li>Electric Vehicles</li>
                <li>Vehicles running on fuel cells</li>
                <li>Vertical Farming</li>
                <li>Power generation</li>
                <li>Healthcare</li>
                <li>3D Printing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These are just some of the fields where a lot of changes and improvements can be made.<br>
                For example - 3D printing materials are still expensive and hence have found little application in niche
                areas although the potential is huge.<br>
                Cleaner transportation requires more infrastructure for rechargin/refuelling, maintainence etc.<br>
                Agriculture is also responsible for a lot of emissions like fossil fuels and require a revolution.<br>
                Healthcare is becoming more and more expensive in terms of time and money both. It should not become a
                luxury and hence needs an overhaul(or several of them).
            </p>
            <p>
                There are already lots of innovations happening in these areas but many do not scale to have a major
                effect. That too is something we need to work on.
