        <p>
            Hello. My name is Akashdeep Singh and I am a resident of Mumbai. <br>
            I am a PG1 M.Tech CSE Student at IIIT Hyderabad and done my B.E. in Computer Engineering under Mumbai University. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I both like and hate a lot of things just like many people. My interests you can check out in the "Interests" page.<br>
            As for some of the books I have read you can check the "Readings" page.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since I am a CSE student I am interested in coding. My preferred languages are C++ and Python. <br>
            I have tried out tools available in their ecosystem (after all a language's value is determined by the ecosystem it has).<br>
            I have also worked on both Linux(Ubuntu) and Windows systems and prefer to work with what is best right now. After all the tools for working on graphics
            are not so great on Linux as much as they are on Windows.
        </p>

        <p>
            My Github profile(linked above) has a mix of things I do. There is no set direction when it comes to what I do as I have been trying out different
            things there are to do. <br>
            You can see over there that I have tried out some C++ game programming, some Android development, some NodeJS.
